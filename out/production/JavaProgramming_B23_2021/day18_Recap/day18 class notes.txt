package name: day18_Recap

1. Ask user to enter a word. If the work contains starts with x, print the word without x.
                    Input:
                        xcode

                    Output:
                        code

2. Ask user to enter two words. Then add them together and print. But if the last letter if the first word and the first letter of the last letter is the same, print that character once.
                    Input:
                        one
                        eight

                    Output:
                        oneight

3. Ask user to enter a word, 
		if the word starts with digits, print "first character is digit"
		if the word starts with uppercase letters, print "first character is lowercase letter"
		if the word starts with lowercase letters, print "first character is uppercase letter"
		if the word starts with special characters, print "first character is special character"

String:
		
		object

		immutable

		char sequences



String methods: charAt, length, toLowerCase, toUpperCase, trim, indexOf, lastIndexOf, substring, replace, replaceFirst
				isEmpty, equals, equalsIgnoreCase, contains, startsWith, endsWith

				charAt(index): returns char. rteurns the character at the given index

				length(): rteuns int. returns total number of characters
							last index: length() -1

				toLowerCase/toUpperCase: returns new string
							String str = "JAVA";
									str = str.toLowerCase(); //"java"

									sout(str); //java

				trim(): returns new string. removes all the white spaces

								String str = "     ";
										str.trim(); //""


				indexOf( character(s) ): returns int.
				lastIndexOf(character): returns int.

				substring(beigging, ending index): returns new String. crtes substring starting from given beginning index till ending index. ENDING INDEX IS EXCLUDED

				replace(old, new): returns new string. replaces ALL old value with given new value
							str = "Dog Cat";
							str = str.replace("Cat", "Dog"); // "Dog Dog"

				replaceFirst(old, new):returns new string. replaces FIRST old value ONLY with given new value



Task: 
	1. EmailTask1:
			Assume that email address is constructed by person's first name and followed by an underscore and last name.
			Write a program that can swap first name with last name in the email (Seperated by an underscore). If the email doesn't contain an underscore print the given input email.	

			Ex:
				input: mike_tyson@gmail.com
				output: tyson_mike@gmail.com



	2. EmailTask2:
		Assume that email address is constructed by person's first name and followed by an underscore and last name.
		Write a program that will print out information about user based on email. Print first name, last name, and domain.
	   	First and Last name should be printed with proper format - uppercase first letter and remaining lowercase.

   			Ex:
   				input: 
   					craig_federighi@apple.com

				Output: 
					First name: Craig
					Last name: Federighi
					Domain: apple
