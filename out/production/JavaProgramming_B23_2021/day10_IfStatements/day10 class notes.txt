warmup Tasks:
	1.  Campus time: User enters a time(hour in 24 hour format) and will be able to find out if the campus is open or not.
			Campus is open from 8 am(8) to 11 pm (23) If user enters a time within the open time they should see message: “open” 
			but if the time entered is outside of operating hours they should see: “ closed”

	2. Write a program that can calculate the salary after tax based on the following requirments.
				the tax rates are:
						35% for salary of 130K or more
						30% for salary of 100K to 129k
						25% for salary of 80K to 99K
						20% for salary of 79K or less

				in addition,if the person is married, he/she will pay 5% less tax

	3. Write a function which prints out the number. but for number which is a multiple of 3, print "FIN" instead of the number
    and for number which is a multiple of 5, print "RA" instead of the number. and for number which is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FINRA" instead of the number.
    		ex:
    			number = 3

    		output:
    			FIN

    			number = 10

			output:
				RA

				number = 15

			output:
				FINRA

				number = 8;

			output:
				8

Tasks:
	You are diving in the ocean. Your oxygen tank has a certain level (number) and you must print a message based on the level:
				Above 90 -  Your tank is full
				Above 80 -  Still okay
				Above 70 -  Don't go too far
				Above 60 -  Start to head back
				Above 50 -  Be careful now you at at 50%

				USE ONE PRINT STATEMENT ONLY
	

If statemnts: if the condition is true, the block gets executed
	single if: 1 option/possibilities
	if & else": 2 options/possibilities
	multi-branch if: 3 or more options/possibilities
	nested if: pre-conditions

Nested If: if condition can be evaluated to multiple scenario

		if(pre-condition){

			if(condition1){
				statement1
			}else{
				statement2
			}	

		}else{
			 statement3
		}


		statement1: precondition & condition1 MUST be true
		statement2: pre-condition MUST be true & condition1 is false
		statement3: precondition MUST be false



Tasks:
	1. NamesOfMonth:  1~12
	2. ConvertNumberToWords: 0~9

	3. Campus time: User enters a time(hour in 24 hour format) and will be able to find out if the campus is open or not 
			Campus is open from 8 am(8) to 11 pm (23)
			If user enters a time within the open time they should see message : “open” but if the time entered is outside of operating hours they should see: “ closed”
			If the user enters an invalid hour (negative number or more than 24 hours) they should see an error message: “invalid time”

Ternary: shortcut of if statement

		int number = 100;
		String result = "";

		if(number%2==0){ 
			result = "Even";
		}else{ 
			result = "Odd";
		}

	String result = (number%2==0) ? "Even" : "Odd";

	(condition)? means if yeyword
	: means the else keyword
	:(condition)? means else if

	if:  ()?
	else:  :
	else if:  :()?
