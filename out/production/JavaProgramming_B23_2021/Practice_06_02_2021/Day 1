Warmup tasks:
			
			Task01:
					1.  Create directory named "OfficeHours" under the folder "Java Programming B23"
					2.  Right Click Over folder ,choose "Mark Directory As" make it "Sources Root"
					3.  Create a package named "Practice_Date"




			Task02:   Variables(Primitives - Non Primitives ),Concatenation and Escape Sequences 

					  Create class named "PersonInfo" and make a main method 

						    Create variables and give value related to you:

						        - String name
						        - byte age
						        - char gender
						        - boolean student
						        - short number of siblings
						        - long favorite number
						        - int number of seasons in your area
						        - double birth date: (month.day)
						        - int year
						        - String full birthday date with year
						        - String favorite quote
						        - Print the person information with using concat/escape characters 

						    



			Task03:   Casting and Variables Practice 

			Task04:   Aritmetic Operators 

						1. Create class named "TemperatureConverter" and make a main method 

						- Write a Java program to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius degree
						- Input a degree in Fahrenheit: 212

							Formula : 		C = (5(F-32))/9
							
							Expected Output:
							212.0 degree Fahrenheit is equal to 100.0 in Celsius 

						2.Create class named "TimeConverter" and make a main method 

						- Write a Java program to convert time from second to hours/min/day format 
						- Input Seconds : 3695

							
							Expected Output:
							inputSeconds is 3695
							1 hours 1 minutes 35 seconds



			Task05:   Relational,Unary,Shortand Practice
