Variable: makes the data reusable

	delare variable:
		DataType variableName =  Data;

		DataType decides what can be stored into variable


primitives data types:
		
		numerical primitives: byte, short, int, long, float, double

				double > float > long > int > short > byte

				larger primitive type CAN NOT be assigned to the smaller primitive type

			integer numbers: byte, short, int(more prefered), long 

							long > int > short > byte

			decimal numbers: float, double (more prefered)


			prefered primitives:
				int: for all whole numbers
				double: for all the decimal numbers
