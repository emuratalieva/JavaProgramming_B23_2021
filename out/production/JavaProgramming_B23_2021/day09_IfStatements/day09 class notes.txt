package name: day09_IfStatements

warmup tasks:
	1. write a program that can print out the maximum number between two different numbers
	        Ex:
	            num1 = 20;
	            num2 = 30;

            output:
	                30 is the maximum number

    2. write a program that can print out the minimum number between two different numbers

        Ex:
            num1 = 20;
            num2 = 30;

            output:
                20 is the minimum number

    3. write a program that can find the number of days in a month (Assume that Feb has 28 days)
            Ex:
                month = 2

            output:
                    28 days

        Hints: you will need single if statements for:
            28 days: 2
            30 days: 4, 6, 9, 11
            31 days: 1, 3, 5, 7,8,10, 12


single if: for one condition

    if(condition){
        statement;
    }


if & else statement: when there are only two options/possibilities (not more not less than 2 condition)
    
            if(condition1){
                statement1
            }else{ // otherwise
                statement2
            }

            statement1: gets executed if condition is true
            statement2: gets executed if condition is false


            odd or even
            pass or fail
            yes or no
            eligble or not eligible


multi-branch if: when there are three  or more options/possibilities 
        
        if(condition1){
            statement1;
        }else if(condition2){
            statement2
        }...

        else{
            statment3;
        }

    execution:
        if block: condition is true
        else if block: condition is true && previous conditions are false
        else block: ALL previous conditions are false




Tasks:
     1. write program that can print out the name of the day based on the number 1 ~ 7  (7 conditions)
     2. write a program that can print out the name of the month based on the number 1 ~ 12 (12 conditions)
     3. GradeReport
            A: 90 ~ 100
            B: 80 ~ 89
            C: 70 ~ 79 
            D: 60 ~ 69
            F:  <60



If statements:
    single if statement: for one conditional statement
    if & else satement: for two conditional statements ONLY (not less  and not more than 2)
    multi-branch if: for three or more conditional statements

    nested if statement: for pre-condition

ternary



X and Y

    possible outcomes:
        X is greater
        Y is greater
        equal
