import statement:
		
		import java.util.Scanner;  // scanner was presented in "java.util"

		import java.lang.Double;	// not needed, becasue the class is in java.lang package
		import java.lang.String; // not needed


String class: presented in "java.lang" 
			 any class in "java.lang" package will be imported automatically


		 1. Object. there are two ways of creating object:
		 					1. String literals:
		 							 String name = "Daniel"; // all string literal will be in string pool


 							 2. by using new keyword:
 							 		String name = new String("Daniel");  // everytime when we use new keyword new object in heap will be created


		 		Java Heap: memory location in java where all the objects will be saved at

		 		String pool: special memory location. ONLY for String literl objects
		 					does not create duplicated objects

		2. String is sequences of characters
					"Cat" == "CAT"

					each character in String has reprsentive number called index number

					index number: strating from zero

					String name = "Cybertek 1";
					//index:       0123456789


		3. String is immutable
				once the object is created it cannot be modified

String methods:
		charAt(index Number): returns the character at the given index

		length(): returns total number of characters in the string.  retunrs it as int

		toLowerCase(): returns new String with lowercases of old string characters

		toUpperCase(): returns new String with uppercases of old string characters

		trim(): removes the white spaces (unused space) and returns new string object

					"       Cybertek   School              "

		substring(beginning index, ending index): creates substring of the string strating from beginning index till endinging index. ending index is excluded

		substring(beginning index): creates substring from given beginning index till the end of the string


		replace(old value, new value): repalces all the old values with new value. returns new string

					"Java Programming language";
					"Java"




lunch Tasks:
	1. write a program that asks user to enter a sentence.
		then print the first & last characters of the sentence

	2. write a program that asks user to enter two strings, and print out the longest string

	3. Write a program that will reverse a string. Your program should reverse a string only 5 characters long. If word is shorter, display message: "Too short!". If word is longer, display message: "Too long!". Otherwise, reverse this word and print out result into the console.
