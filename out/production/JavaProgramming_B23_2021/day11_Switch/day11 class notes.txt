If statements short quiz due by 12 pm






 if block  					()?
 else if block  			:()?
 else block    				:

{}

switch statements: switch, case, default, break

	syntax: 
		switch(Data){ 5 ,

			case data1:
					statement1;
					break;  // closes the block and exits the switch

			case data2:
					statement2;
					break;

			case data3:
					statement3;
					break;

			default: 
					statemnt4
					break;

		}

		case value MUST match with switch' dataType and Unique

		break: used for exiting the switch
				if we dont give the break statement in case blocks, the next block gets executed until reaches break statement or closing curly braces of switch

		default: gets executed if none of the cases are matched
				there can only be one default block

		4 data types cannot be passed ins switch:
				long, double, float, boolean 


		|| logic we can use in the switch by declaring the cases back to back with break statement
