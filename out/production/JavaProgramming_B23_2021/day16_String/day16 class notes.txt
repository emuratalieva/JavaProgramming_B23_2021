warmup tasks:
	1. write a method that asks user to enter a string.
	        if the string is empty, print: string is empty
	        if the string has more than 3 characters, print the last three characters
	        if the string has less than or equal 3 characters, print the string itself

	2. Ask user to enter two words. Print first word without its first character then print the second word without its first character.
	                Input:
	                    apple
	                    banana
	                Output:
	                    ppleanana

	3. write a program that asks the user enter a three letter word. Check if the middle character of the given word is 'a'. In the case it is print: "Cool word", but in the case the middle letter is not 'a' print: "Okay word". 
	     - If the user does not enter a 3 letter word tell them: 
	     		If the word is less than 3 letters: "Word is too short"
	     		If the word is too long: "Word is too long"

	4. Write a program  for CheckWords:
	        Program accepts 3 words and :
	            - if they are same length:  print "All words are same length"
	            - if some same length and others not:    print "Not Same nor Different lengths"
	            - if all different length :  print "All different length"
