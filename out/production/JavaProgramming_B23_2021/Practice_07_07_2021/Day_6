	Array Intro : 	


	Task 1    : Write a program that accepts an array and prints an array with the elements "rotated left”
		
		int[] x = {1,2,3};			 // = > [2,3,1]
		int[] y = {17,12,10,8};		 // = > [12,10,8,17] 
		int[] a = {7,0,0}; 			 // = > [0,0,7]


	Task 2 :	Write a program that accepts string and prints multiple words in the string				
						
        "knife, wooden spoons, plates, cups, forks, pan, pot, trash can, fridge, dish washer”
         
        output : wooden spoons	
        		 trash can
         		 dish washer


	Task 3 : Write a program that accepts String array.Count how many names have the same first and last letter

				Input : "Anna", "Mike", "Aliya", "Donald", "Muhtar", "Remus", "Mehmet","Asya"

				Output : 4 
    
    Task 4 :  For Each - Nested For 

    		Longest Palindrome
       		 
       		 Given a String array. Find the longest Palindrome String in your array.
			        Ex:
			        Input: [“java”, “longer word”, “civic” “apple”, “racecar”, “mom”, “anna”] Output: racecar
			        Ex:
			        Input: [“abc”, “dna”, “kevin”, “joe”, “lamp”]
			        Output: No palindrome



    Task 5 : Longest Repetitive Substring -- Real Interview Task


    		Write a program if some substring K that can be repeated N>1 times to produce the input string exactly as it appears.
    		Your program should return longest substring K, and 
    		if there is none it should be return "There is no repetitive substring"

    		For Example is str ="abcababcababcab"  			   output should be abcab
    					   str ="abcdefabcdef"     			   output should be abcdef
    					   str ="abcdefabcdefabcdefabcdef"     output should be abcdefabcdef
    					   str ="abcdefxabcdef"				   output should be "There is no epetitive substring"
