package name: day25_ForEachLoop

Warmup task:
	1. write a program that can  reverse each elements in an array of string
		Ex:
		    array = {"Java", "Python", "C#"}

	    	output:
	    		["avaJ", "nohtyP", "#C"]


	2. write a program that can merge two arrays of integers
		Ex:
			arr1 = {1,2,3,4}
			arr2 = {5,6}

		output
			arr3 = {1,2,3,4,5,6}


3 data structures:
	Arrays
	Collections
	Maps



For each loop: a loop that's already iterated. 
				iteration stated from index 0 till the last index (fixed)


				pre condition: there MUST be a data structure

				sytax:

					for(DataType Variable   : Collection of Data){

					}

					DataType MUST match with Collection of Data



Tasks:
	1. create an array named classmates, and store 10 of your classmates' names
			use for each loop to print first three letters of each name

	2. write a program that can print the unique elements from an array of string
			Ex:
				{"java", "java", "python", "c#"}

			output:
				python c#


				MUST use for each loop



single dimensional array: array that contains data

multiple dimensional array: array that contains array
