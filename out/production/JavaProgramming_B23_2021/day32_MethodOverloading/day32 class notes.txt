package name: day32_MethodOverloading


Task1:
    1. create a method that can find the sum of two numbers
                    method name: sumOf2Numbers

    2. create a method that can find the sum of three numbers
                    method name: sumOf3Numbers

    3. create a method that can find the sum of four numbers
                    method name: sumOf4Numbers

Task2:
	1. create a return method called addInteger that can add an Inteeger  after the  last index of an integer array

    2. create a return method called addDouble that can add a double after the last index of a double array

    3. create a return method called addString that can add a String after the last index of a String array

    4. create a return method called addChar that can add a char after last index of a char array



method overloading: multiple methods shares same method name.
					
					Parameter MUST BE different ( either the dataType of parameter or the number of parameter)

					Smae method name different parameters


					advantage:
							1. easy to memorize
							2. easy to read
							3. reusable
							4. flexible





Tasks:
