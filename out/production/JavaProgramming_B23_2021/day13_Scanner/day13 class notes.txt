declare:
	Scanner  scan =  new Scanner(System.in);


Scanner methods:
		
		nextInt(): returns int
		nextDouble(): returns double

		nextBoolean(): return true/false

		next(): returns string. ONLY takes the first word
				DO NOT USE IT IF THE INPUT HAS MORE THAN ONE WORDS
				WE ONLY IT USE WHEN WE NEED ONE WORD IN INPUT

		nextLine(): returns string. Takes everything that scanner has. Even the Enter key
				WE ONLY USE IT WHEN WE NEED MORE THAN ONE WORD IN INPUT

				if netxLine() is being used after any other methods of scanner, we need to give one more nextLine method to clear the scanner memory

		close(): closes the scanner
