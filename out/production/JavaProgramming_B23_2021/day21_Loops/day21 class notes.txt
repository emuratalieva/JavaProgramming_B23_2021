Topics: while & do-While loops

package name: day21_Loops

warmup tasks:
	1. write a program that can multiply two positive numbers without using * operator

			5 & 3 = 5 + 5+ 5 = 15

			15

	2.  Write a program that can print the numbers between 1 ~ N that can be divisible by 3, 5, and 15.
            if the number can be divisible by 3, 5 and 15,
                then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy15' section

            if the number can be divisible by 3 but cannot be divisible by 15,
                then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy3' section

            if the number can be divisible by 5 but cannot be divisible by 15,
                then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy5' section

            EX:
            	input: 100
	            Output:
	                 Divisible By 15: 15 30 45 60 75 90
	                 Divisible By 5: 5 10 20 25 35 40 50 55 65 70 80 85 95 100
	                 Divisible By 3: 3 6 9 12 18 21 24 27 33 36 39 42 48 51 54 57 63 66 69 72 78 81 84 87 93 96 99

     3. Write a program that can return the sum of digits froma  string
     		Ex:
     			input: A1B2C3

     			output: 6
     					1+2+3

	4. write a program that can retive the digits, letters and special characters from a string
			Ex:
				input:
					mn@#123Ab!

				output:
					letters: mnAb
					digits: 123
					special chars: @#!
