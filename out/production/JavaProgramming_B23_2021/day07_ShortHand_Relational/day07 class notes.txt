package name: day07_ShortHand_Relational

warmup tasks:
	1. write a program that can swipe two variables' value by using a temporary variable
			ex:
				if a= 10, b=15

				output:
					a = 15
					b = 10

	2. manually calculate the following code fragements:

                1. int a = 100;
                   int b = -a++ + ++a - a-- * a-- % 2



ShortHand: for numbers. re-assigns the variable
	=: asisgnement
		int a = 5;
			a = 10;
			sout(a); // 10


	+=: addition assignement ( can be applicable to string)
		a = 20;
		a = a + 10;  ==   a+=10


Relational Operators:
	>: greater
		10 > 10 ==> false

	>=: greater or equal

		 10 >= 10 ==> true

	<: less

	<=: less than or equal

	==: equal

	!=: not equal



or logic: ||  either. if either one is true, will return true
	True: at least one condition is true
	False: if both conditions are false

	eiteher prime meber  or   price>= 25


and logic: &&  both. if both conditions are true, will return true
	True: if both conditions are true
	False: at least one condition is false

	to Vote:
		1. MUST be US citizen
		2. at least 18 years old

		Must be US citizen  OR  at least 18 years old



task:
	1.eligible to buy alcohol
	2. valid triangle: sum of three angles MUST be 180
			a1, a2, a3

			(a1 + a2 + a3)  == 180 // first get the sum of three angles, then compare it with 180

	PassOrFail
			pass: score >= 60
			fail: score <60


	3. EligileForLoan
			income has to be at least 60k
			at least have 2 years of work history
			at least have 700 of credit score 
			at least 18 years old

		variables:	name, age, workHistory, creditScore, income

	4. PosNegZero
			write a program that can check if a number is Positive, negative or zero

				Ex:
					number = 100;

				    output:
				    	100 is positive number: true
				    	100 is negative number: false
				    	100 is zero: false


	5. OddOrEven
			number = 11;

			even:  number%2 == 0;

			odd:   number%2 != 0;
					even == false




  "A" + 12 ==> A12
  'A' + 12 ==> 77
