					1.EstimatedTimeCalculator

   							Assume that you have a plan to go from A to B point
   							maxSpeed=80
   							minSpeed=40

   							- Ask the User 
   								- Car speed 
   											should be 40 - 80 mph
   										-> if user enters smaller than minSpeed
   																or  
   													 	   bigger than maxSpeed
   										-   assign for speed 60 as default 
   										-   otherwise assign for speed userInput(int)
   									
   								- startingpoint(string) and destination(string)
   								- distance between this two points(double)
   		
   								According to this information calculate triptime;

   								Formula of estimatedTime = distance/speed;

   							   	Ex : 

   										Inputs :50,San Antonio,Dallas,300 
   			
   										"The Estimated Time Of Arrival is 6.0 hours from San Antonio to Dallas "	

				---------------------------------------

   					2.CarpetShop	  

						- Ask the user which room do they need carpet? (String)
									List of Rooms 
										Bedroom
										Kitchen

				            -> If the user gives other than these roomTypes ,  give an error message about "Invalid Room Type"
				        
				        - Ask the user roomType dimensions (as meter and double)
				        		Kitchen is circle.Take radius from user 
				        		Bedroom is square or Rectangle.Take lenght and width from user 
				        
				        - Ask the user to delivery address (String, multiple words)
				        - unitPriceForCarpet = 3.92
				        - totalcost = area*unitPriceForCarpet;
				        
				        - Print in the following format:
				            Ex:
				                inputs: Bedroom,length 4,width 3,1300 Lamar St Houston TX 77010

				                 "TotalCost for your carpet is 51.84 and it will be delivery 1300 Lamar St Houston TX 77010 in one week"  


			Topic : String Methods


				Intro : String Pool 
						equals Vs == Operator
						equalsIgnoreCase
				
				---------------------------------------

				(substring-length-concat)
 				
 				1. Create a method return a new string made of 3 copies of the last 2 chars of the original string. The string length will be at least 2.
						
						Input: "Hello" → "lololo" 
						Input: "ab"    → "ababab"
						Input:  "Hi"   → "HiHiHi"

				---------------------------------------
				(substring-length-isEmpty)
				
				2.Given a string, return the string made of its first two chars, so the String "Hello" yields "He". If the string is shorter than length 2, return whatever there is, so "X" yields "X", and the empty string "" yields the empty string "".
					
					Input :"Hello"   → "He" 
					Input :"abcdefg" → "ab" 
					Input :"a"	     → "a"
					Input :""	     → "It can not be empty"		
				---------------------------------------

                (length-substring || replace )
			   
			    3.Given a string, return a version without the first and last char, so "Hello" yields "ell".
			      The string length will be at least 2.
					
					Input : "Hello" → "ell" 
					Input : "java" → "av" 
					Input : "coding" → "odin"
				
				---------------------------------------

				(lowercase - substring - length )
    			
    			4.Ask the user enter a word with at least 3 characters
    	
				    	print first - last - middle character

				    	if word length is even  print out 2 char from middle as in example
				    		
				    		Input : Cybertek 
				    				first character :C //make it lowercase
				    				last character  :k
				    				middle characters:er
				        
				        if word length is odd  print out  char from middle as in example

				    		Input : Statement 
				    				first character :s //make it lowercase
				    				last character  :k
				    				middle characters:e			
				---------------------------------------
				
				(indexOf - length - substring - lowercase )

				5.Creating an email
				        
				    Ask user to enter fullname. FirstName and lastName should be at least 6 character long.
				    If they are shorter than that print “Invalid data” and program should end.
				    If the information provided is valid, you will take the first 4 characters of first string and combine them with the last three characters of the second string. At the end of your combined string add “@cybertek.com” and print the final string as your created email.
				    The final email should be in all lowercase.
				    
				    input: JamesBond Secret
				    output: jameret@cybertek.com
