Review Topcis: Singel dimensional Array
			   for each loop
			   muli-dimensional array (two dimensional)
			   Arrays Utility & String methods

Package name: day27_Recap


Array: one of the three data structures
		size is fixed

		ordered data structure (index)

	single dimensional array: store multiple data

	multi-dimensional array: store multiple arrays



for each: already iterated.
		  iteration order is not changable (0 to last index)



Arrays Utilty class:
		Arrays.toString(): for printing 1 D array
		Arrays.deepToString(): for printing muli D array
		Arrays.sort(): sorts the array in ascending
		Arrays.equals(): compares two arrays objects

		Arrays.copyOf()
		ARrays.copyOfRange()




On Thursday: Custom methods



first unique element from the array:
		array: [1,2,1,3,3,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,7,7,7, 8]

		output:
			2 


Given:
		String[] items  = {"Shoes", "Jacket",  "Gloves", "Airpods", "iPad", "iphone 12 case" };
        double[] prices = {99.99,      150.0,  9.99,     250.0 ,    439.50,  39.99};
        int[] itemIDs =   {12345 ,     12346,  12347,    12348,     12349,    12350};


        1. find out the first index of "Gloves" (for loop)

        2. find out if "iPad" is contained in the item list (for loop or for each)

        3. Print a report of each shopping item (for loop)
        	name - price - #ID
