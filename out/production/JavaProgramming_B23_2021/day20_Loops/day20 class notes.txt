warmup tasks:     
	1. Write a program that can return the factorial number of any given number

            Ex:
                input: 5
                output: 120  ( because: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2* 1 = 120 )


    2. write a program that can return the frequncy of the a word Java from the sentence 

        Ex:
            sentence = "Java Java";
           
            output:
                2

    3. write a program to print true if the string "cat" and "dog" appear the same number of times in the given sentence

    	Ex:
    		sentence = "cat dog dog cat"

    		output:
    			true

	4. Write a program that calculates the sum of numbers entered by the user until user enters a negative number.

            hint: you need an infinite loop


Branching Statements:
		break statement: exits the loop & switch 
		continue statement: skips the current iteration
