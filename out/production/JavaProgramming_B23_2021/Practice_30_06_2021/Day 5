			Topic : Unit 1 Task


						CarComputer

						- Assume that ;

							- You live  Houston city in TX state.
							- You will go to a trip and you have 3 choice 

								== Distance from Houston ==

									San Antonio   250 mil
									Dallas		  300 mil	
									Austin.       200 mil 

							- Unit Price Of Fuel is $ 3.06
							- Average Fuel Consumption is 3.2 gal/100 mil
							- Max speed is 80 mph
							- Min speed is 40 mph

						According to this information 
						
							Ask the user :

						1. Do you want to start the car ? (as boolean)

							 	true : Continue trip
							 	false: Give a message " see you later "		


						2.if user continues to trip 
							 		
							 		Which city do you want to go ?  (as String)
										List of cities 
											San Antonio
											Dallas
											Austin	
								    
								    According to user answer assign your distance related values.
								   
								    If user input is out of this cities assign as distance 0 				

                        3.if user choose one of these city assign your speed  60 mph as default

                                	Then Give this info message for user (as int)
                                		
                                		to increase the speed press 0  
										to decrease the speed press 1

							Option -1 ----- if user press 0 
									
									Ask user "How much would you like to increase the speed?"
								
										If totalSpeed is bigger than maxspeed don't do any changes in speed 
										otherwise you can change(increase) speed according to input  	

										Example :

											Default speed:60 mph
											User Input :30 mph 

											output: "It is not allowed.Your speed is " + 60

											Default speed:60 mph
											User Input :15 mph 

											output: "Your speed is increased!"+ 75

							Option -2 -----if user press 1 
									
									Ask user "How much would you like to decrease the speed?"
								
										If totalSpeed is smaller than minSpeed don't do any changes in speed 
										otherwise you can change(decrease) speed according to input  	

										Example :

											Default speed:60 mph
											User Input :30 mph 

											output: "It is not allowed.Your speed is " + 60

											Default speed:60 mph
											User Input :15 mph 

											output: "Your speed is increased!"+ 45

							Option -3 -----if user press any number other than 0 or 1 

										Give an info message 

 											"Your speed is not changed!" + $speed

 									Ex : 	"Your speed is not changed!" + 60


			
 						3.According to all inputs print out this result

	 						EstimatedTime  		 : distance/speed
	 						
	 						TotalFuelConsumption : EstimatedTime*Average Fuel Consumption;
	 						
	 						TotalPriceForFuel	 : TotalFuelConsumption*Unit Price Of Fuel 

						======= Example ======== 		

						Inputs : true , San Antonio,1,10

		   								========== Results ===========
										Estimated Time         : 5.0
										Total Fuel Consumption : 16.0 gal
										Total Price Price      : $48.96

						  Repeat this steps the user enters correct pinCode 



				Task 2 :  While 

						  Write a program that can return the sum of digits of an integer 
				          (Do not use any string manipulations	)

						  Ex: aaabbbcccccddddee Output: ccccc
						    	     


			Topic : Arrays 
						- Intro
						- Array Methods 
										- toString()
										- equals()
										- sort()
					    - String Methods 
					    				- split


				 Task 1    : Write a method that accepts an array and prints an array with the elements "rotated left”
		
								int[] x = {1,2,3};			 // = > [2,3,1]
								int[] y = {17,12,10,8};		 // = > [12,10,8,17] 
								int[] a = {7,0,0}; 			 // = > [0,0,7]


				Task 2 :	Write a method that accepts an array and prints multiple words in the array				
						
        					"knife, wooden spoons, plates, cups, forks, pan, pot, trash can, fridge, dish washer”
         
        					output : wooden spoons
