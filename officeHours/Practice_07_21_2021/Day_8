	Task 1 :   Create a method called calcFeetAndInchesToCentimeters . It needs to have two parameters.
			   Feet is the first parameter, inches is the second parameter.
				
				- You should validate that the first parameter feet is >=0, and second parameter inches is >=0 and <=12.
					 Return -1 from the method if either of the above is not true.
				
				- If the parameters are valid, then calculate how many centimeters comprise the feet and inches passed to this 		  method and return that value.
				
				- Create a second method of the same name but with only one parameter inches is the parameter and validate it 		  >=0, return -1 if it is not true. But if it is valid, then calculate how many feet are in the inches.
				
				- Call the other overloaded method passing the correct feet and inches calculated so that it can calculate 				correctly.
				
				- Hints : Use double for your number datatypes 1 inch = 2.54cm and 1 ft =12 inches

	
	Task 2 :  Fibonacci

				Create a method that will give you the Fibonacci numbers up to the x value. Where x is the given parameter.

				Fibonacci is a sequence of number starting from 0, 1 where the following numbers are the sum of the previous 2 numbers
				
				Note: Fibonacci numbers are read as index values, so the 0th Fibonacci is 0, 1st value is 1, 2nd value is 1, etc

				    Ex:
				        Input:
				            8
				        Output:
				            0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
